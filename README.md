# Group 5 Project 2: ETL Mini Project
Members: Sindhuja, Wendy, David, Uth, Bailey 
<!-- Feel free to change this to better suit you! -->
## Overview

For the ETL mini project, you will work in a group to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Objectives

1.  **Extract and Transform Data**: Use Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
2.  **Create CSV Files**: Generate four CSV files from the transformed data.
3.  **Design an ERD**: Create an Entity Relationship Diagram based on the CSV file data.
4.  **Define Table Schema**: Develop a table schema for the Postgres database.
5.  **Load Data into Postgres**: Upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Collaboration and Communication

-   **Divide the Work**: While tasks will be divided, ensure that all members are familiar with all aspects of the project.
-   **Regular Check-Ins**: Frequently check in with your group to discuss progress, address issues, and offer support.
-   **Collaborative Tools**: Utilize collaborative tools like shared documents, version control systems (e.g., Git), and communication platforms (e.g., Slack) to facilitate teamwork.

## Tools and Technologies

-   **Python**: For data extraction and transformation.
-   **Pandas**: To manipulate and transform data.
-   **Regular Expressions / Dictionary Methods**: To assist with data extraction.
-   **CSV Files**: For storing transformed data and extracting raw data.
-   **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: To visualize database structure.
-   **Postgres Database**: For loading and storing the final data.
